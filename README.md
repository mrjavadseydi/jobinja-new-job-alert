## Setup

Update the `jobinja.py` file:

1. Set your Telegram bot token on line 11.
2. Set your chat ID on line 12.
3. Add links from Jobinja to the URLs list.
4. Set a cron job to run every 5 minutes: `*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/script && python3 app.py`

## Important Notice
Telegram is banned in Iran, so you need to set this up on a foreign server.
